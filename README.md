# Epidemic modelling using extended VAP-SIRS model

The project is a streamlit application that allows modeling of epidemics taking into account vaccinated and more susceptible people, with different parameter values.

Running `streamlit run app.py` will launch an application that allows tracking various epidemic scenarios, including tracking seasonal variations.
